<p>Doctrine (Latin: doctrina) is a codification of beliefs or "a body of teachings" 
or "instructions", taught principles or positions, as the body of teachings in a 
branch of knowledge or belief system. The Greek analogy is the etymology of catechism.
Often doctrine specifically connotes a corpus of religious dogma as it is promulgated 
by a church, but not necessarily: doctrine is also used to refer to a principle of law,
 in the common law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as 
the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use, or the more narrowly applicable 
first-sale doctrine. In some organizations, doctrine is simply defined as 'that which is 
taught', in other words the basis for institutional teaching of its personnel internal 
ways of doing business.</p>
